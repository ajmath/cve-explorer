# cve-explorer

This is a sample application used as a test bed for full-stack web application
development with react, graphql, and java.  The application consists of two main components: a create-react-app frontend and a SpringBoot graphql backend.

## Running locally

To get started, you'll want to have multiple terminal tabs open. One for each
component.  We'll start with the server since the frontend isn't any good
without it

### Running the server

#### Prequisites
* Java 1.8 (It may work with later versions but it is untested)

Getting started:
1) Navigate to the `api/` directory
2) Run `./gradlew bootRun` to start up the server.  _This will take some time
   as needs to load up almost two decades of CVE incidents from disk into memory_
3) If all goes well, you can open your browser to http://localhost:9055 to see a 
   [graphql-playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground) UI that you
   can use to query the API.  Here is a sample query to get you going:
```graphql
query {
  cveSearch(input: { query: "javascript", limit: 5 }) {
    results {
      id
      index
      description
      severity
      publishedOn
    }
  }
}
```
 4) If everything is working correctly,  you should see a list of CVEs pertaining
    to javascript in the right-hand pane.  Feel free to explore the schema tab on
    the right and explore the data by adding the fields to your query

### Running the client

#### Prequisites
* NodeJS runtime that matches the version in [`.nvm`](./app/.nvm) ([nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) can help with this)
* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) (although npm _may_ work in a pinch)

Getting started:
1) Navigate to the `api/` directory
2) Run `yarn install` to install dependencies
3) Run `yarn start` to start the web app.  If all goes well, a browser window
   should pop up with the app running on http://localhost:3000
